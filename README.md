# Edgequest Launcher

Edgequest is a rougelike inspired, top down game. The game takes place in a infinite sandbox that contains an above ground and multiple levels of underground dungeons. This demo has been written in Java and OpenGL to help illustrate the above ground mechanics of the game. Due to its pre-alpha state, many features have yet to be added and optimizations still need to be made.

This is the launcher for edgequest which will fetch the latest version of the game from the internet for you. Simply download the latest release of the launcher and run it.
